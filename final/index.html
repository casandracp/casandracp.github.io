		<h1>Is it a Hot dog? <br /> A Sandwich? S**T?</h1>
        <p>
        Hot dogs are an all american meal but most likely it was german sausage makers who first came up with the idea. Tradictional hot dogs are made from a mixture of <strong>pork, beef and chicken</strong>. The cuts they start with are called <strong>trimmings</strong>, pieces left over from cutting steaks. <strong>Processed </strong>chicken trimmings are also added to the meat, as well as starch salt and other flavouring. Water is added to the mix and everything is blended together with <strong>corn syrup</strong>.
